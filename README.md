##About Me
My name is Vienna May Sauvage and I am a student at NIC in the Advanced Digital Design and Development Program - Design Stream. I have been going to school part time, so even though this program is only a 3 year program it will take me 4. I am in my 3rd year so only 1 more to go after the Winter Semester. 

I love the outdoors, my houseplants, my kitty and my gecko, exploring, and relaxing with my partner at the end of a long, busy day. I can't wait to learn more about coding this semester - it has gotten more interesting the more I learn!
